## What is it?

VPL-Runner is a small prototype on how a code graph, which connects single responsibility processes, would run.  
The graph is written in JSON and the schema based on the noflo schema seen [here](https://github.com/noflo/noflo/blob/master/graph-schema.json).

## How to install and run

Just run `npm install` in the project directory and then `node index graph_file` where `graph_file` is the path to graph file in json format.

## Is it any good?

Not yet. :worried:
